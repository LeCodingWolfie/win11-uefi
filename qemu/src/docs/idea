Scripting GDB might readily help to log multiple functions in particular (break by each), in comparison by Radare which is able to break on (any) call.
It might be better to be able to log every UEFI function, its caller, and a tree of execution, similar to Intel Trace for UEFI debugging, which is also enabled by EDK II.
And also be able to identify or digress between calls on the UEFI platform and the UEFI image, in order to identify if reconstructed code is similar with its counterpart.
Furthermore, for (Windows) image calls, it should be able to research the assembly where the function is called, either after or within execution, which latter may mimic Radare.
And also, enable logging of only certain function (whitelist), or otherwise create a blacklist.
